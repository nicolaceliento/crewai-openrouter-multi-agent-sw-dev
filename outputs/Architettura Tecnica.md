Software Architecture Document

Objective:
The objective of this Software Architecture Document is to outline the technical structure of the "ToDo list per la gestione di attività personali" Web App project, detailing how its components should be integrated and interact with each other effectively.

High-Level System Description:
The system aims to provide users with a reliable and user-friendly platform for managing personal tasks efficiently. It will streamline task organization, priority setting, scheduling, and enhance productivity and time management skills for individuals.

Pattern Architectures Used:
- Model-View-Controller (MVC) for separating the user interface, data, and control logic.
- Client-server architecture for communication between clients and servers.
- Microservices architecture for modular and scalable development.

Global Architectural Diagram:
A diagram showcasing the high-level components of the system, including the frontend, backend, and database layers, illustrating the flow of data and interactions between these components.

Main Components:
1. Frontend:
   - Technologies: React.js for dynamic user interfaces, HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
   - Description: Handles the presentation layer and user interactions.
   
2. Backend:
   - Technologies: Node.js for server-side logic, Express.js framework.
   - Description: Manages business logic, data processing, and interfaces with the database.

3. Database:
   - Technologies: MongoDB for flexible document-based storage.
   - Description: Stores user data, task information, and app configurations.

Relationships and Dependencies:
- Frontend depends on backend APIs for fetching and updating data.
- Backend interacts with the database to perform CRUD operations on task-related information.
- Frontend communicates with the backend using RESTful API endpoints.

Deployment:
The system will be distributed on servers for production, possibly utilizing cloud services like AWS or Azure. Docker containers will be used for application deployment, ensuring consistency across different environments. Serverless architecture may be considered for cost-efficient scaling.

Data Model:
The database will follow a document-based schema in MongoDB, organizing data into collections such as Users, Tasks, Categories, and Reminders.

Request Flow:
- User interacts with the frontend UI to create or modify tasks.
- Frontend sends requests to backend API endpoints.
- Backend processes requests, interacts with the database, and sends responses back to the frontend.

This Software Architecture Document provides a comprehensive technical blueprint for the development of the 'ToDo list per la gestione di attività personali' Web App, aligning with project objectives, constraints, and priorities.
